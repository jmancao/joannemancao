                        <p>In the year 1993, the first graphical web browser that was released is the NCSA Mosiac which can display text and images. The creators of that browser were recruited by a company named Mosiac Communications
                            to rewrite the code of the product. It was named Mosiac Netscape and turned out to be successful. Later on, the company name was changed into Netscape Communications while the browser was Netscape Navigator.
                            Programmer Brendan Eich come up with a JavaScript draft within 10 days which would someday conquer the world of web development. On its first release, it was called Mocha then LiveScript on its Beta 2.0, and 
                            lastly JavaScript on Beta 3. Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International to define standards and be implemented. For it to be shared with other browsers and have similar functionality in their own browsers 
                            where ECMAScript was released. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett come up Ajax, a set of techologies that has JavaScript as its core. Ajax enable webpages to be more dynamic as it can to perform network related task in the background. 
                            The JavaScript rules the front-end and backend delopemnt, server-side and even IOT devices such as Alexa. Personally, Brendan Eich is amazing because he was able to create one within 10 days. As the saying goes, "Expect the unexpected."
                            We will not know that our creations could create a significant impact in our lives and on others.

                        <p>The vanilla JavaScript is does not need to use libraries and frameworks. This proves that things can still be done without using libraries and frameworks. In the variation of ice cream, the vanilla ice cream represent the vanilla JavaScript 
                            because of its common characteristic which is being plain. Even though Vanilla JavaScript in conventional, it can prove that great things can be done through it.</p><br>

                        <p>Several programming language's popularity declined over the years as what the man in the video has said and showed. He added that it is possible that it was due to the pandemic. In the video, JavaScript's popularity declined since new programming 
                            languages are emerging and are growing in number. Developers might also consider and preferred using different languages other than JavaScript. Nevertheless, JavaScript is still the most popular and commonly used programming language to teach to others. 
                            Aside from being free, the software that can run JavaScript is built in every browser so you do not need to install it.</p><br>
